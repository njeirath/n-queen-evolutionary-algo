Like Travis's solution [https://github.com/aiml-satx/n-queen-evolutionary-algo/blob/master/tvaught/n-queens-exploration.ipynb] I use an evolutionary algorithm(EA) but I also wanted to see how an EA would handle removing the unique row and column constraint (A.K.A the N-rooks problem) so I allow queens to occupy any row/column regardless of whether there is already a queen in the row/column.
